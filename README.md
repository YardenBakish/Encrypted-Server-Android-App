# Encrypted-Server-Android-App
Implementation of an encrypted bidirectional communication channel between multiple App users and a Taylor-made multi-threaded server in python
Securing the communication channel is achieved via excecuting the 'Diffie Hellman' key-exchange protocol which results in both the client and the server a uniqe secret key
